# Adstools leak

Adstools is a ads injection tool made by a vietnamese team, it is mainly used for leeching purposes, removing toasts, replace splash screen and inject ads in single process

Where I got that from? I will not tell but I have a friend who works internally who knows the behind the scene of this. I'm never involved in this scene, I just know everything from a friend

Blackmod's ads24h website (now defunct) is a upgraded version of this, works similar and removes toast from smali too! Feature was disabled later. They didn't make own but bought someone to do this. Ads24h is closed for everyone because they got trouble with Google ads and unable to pay anyone, it is now only available for trusted members. Leecher sharing team are still injecting ads and resharing on MOD SHARE EVERY WHERE

Is it safe to share this? sure enough, many modders know how to protect their mod so do not worry, Google ads and some others are protected enough against this fraud. I will share this just to let companies know and to SHAME on leechers!!!

USE THIS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. INJECTING ADS IN ANY APPS IS DETECTABLE AND BANNABLE, I WILL REPORT TO ADS COMPANY IF I SEE YOU USE THIS IN YOUR MODS!
